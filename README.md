# Medical-cost-analysis
This project is a comprehensive powerBI dashboard for analyzing medicalcosts based on demographic and lifestyle factors.The dashboard provides actionable insights to identify key cost drivers and risk factors. 
## Features
 1.Dashboard Overview:Breakdown of medical costs by individual attributes.                                                                        
 2.Demographic Insights:Analysis of age groups,gender,and BMI categories.                                                                              
 3.Regional Insights:Medical cost patterns across diffrent region.                                                                                     
 4.Health Risk Analysis:Impact of smoking and obesity on medical costs.                                                                                 
 5.Custom measures:Includes advanced DAX calculations,such as highest-cost region,percentage contributions,and risk factors.                               
 ## Technologies Used
  1.Power BI:For building interactive dashboards and visuals.                                                                                           
  2.DAX:For creating calculated measures and custom metrics.                                                                                            
  3.Python:For data preprocessing and cleaning.                                                                                                         
 ## Key Insights
  1.Smokers inccur significantly higher medical costs compared to non-smokers.
  2.Obesity is a major cos driver with higher BMI correlating to increased charges.    
  3.Southeast region has the highest average medical charges,while Southwest rerion has the lowest.         
  4.Older age groups (especially 56+) contribute to higher medical charges.
